# Table-detection
This Table detector has been developed using deep learning and convolutional neural networks with the use of OpenCV for masking purposes. 
It can be used to detect tables present in scanned documents such as papers, invoices etc. 
The model was trained on Google Colab using the Marmot dataset v1.0. The model was trained to achieve a training accuracy of ~97% and a validation accuracy of ~97%.
